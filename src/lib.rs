//! # mouse\_sovec
//!
//! `mouse\_sovec` defines `SoVec` for `mouse`, which behaves like `std::collections::Vec` .
//!
//! (`SoVec` stands for `Small optimized Vector` .)
//!
//! `SoVec` will not allocate heap if the requested memory size is small enough.
//! Instead of heap, it uses itself as a buffer then.
//!
//! To avoid allocating as much as possible, the performance is better than that of `std::collections::Vec` .
